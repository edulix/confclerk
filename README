This is the README file for ConfClerk. ConfClerk is the successor of
fosdem-schedule; cf. docs/fosdem-schedule for the historic documentation.


Description:

ConfClerk is an application written in Qt, which makes conference
schedules available offline.  It displays the conference schedule
from various views, support searches on various items (speaker, speech topic,
location, etc.) and enables you to select favorite events and create your own
schedule.

At the moment ConfClerk is able to import schedules in XML format created by
the PentaBarf conference management system used by e.g. FOSDEM, DebConf, and
the CCC.

ConfClerk is targetted at mobile devices like the Nokia N810 and N900 but
works on any sytem running Qt.

See the file ./INSTALL for building and installation instructions, and
./AUTHORS for the list of contributors.

History:

ConfClerk started as fosdem-schedule, targetted at Maemo as an operating
system and the FOSDEM conference.
fosdem-schedule was written by Ixonos Plc., maintained at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fosdem-maemo/ , and released under the GNU GPL
2 or later.
Cf. docs/fosdem-schedule for more information.

ConfClerk is the successor of fosdem-schedule, aiming at improvements and
generalization regarding supported platforms and conference systems.
The project was started after fosdem-schedule was not actively developped
anymore and with the "blessing" of the fosdem-schedule developers; cf.
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20110621171440.GA4521%40nerys.comodo.priv.at&forum_name=fosdem-maemo-devel
