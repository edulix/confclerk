// TODO

  a city field.

Version 0.5.2, 2011-07-23
* Show close button in conference dialog also if there are no conferences
  yet.
* Show event title instead of id in alarm (maemo).

* Various small UI changes, e.g.:
  - cancel button in settings dialogs

  - remove status bar
  - clean up some dialogs

Version 0.5.0, 2011-06-29
* First release of ConfClerk as the fosdem-schedule successor.
* Continue the multi-conference feature, make sure persons/tracks/rooms are
  handled separately per conference.
* Remove FOSDEM- and maemo-specific parts.
* Exchange icons to be sure about the provenance.
* Some code cleanup, most notable: use prepared statements for all SQL
  queries.
